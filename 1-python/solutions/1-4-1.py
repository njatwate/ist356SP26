'''
use the `datetime` module to:

parse a string like this "Month/Day/Year" 1/15/2025 into a datetime
then print it like this: YYYY-MM-DD

For example in the current date is January 15, 2025 the output should be 2025-01-15

You will need to read through the module with `dir()` and `help()` or read the python docs to determine which functions to use.
